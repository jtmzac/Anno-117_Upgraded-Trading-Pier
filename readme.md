## Why not a Technology/Research Node?
I did consider adding this as a research technology but have currently decided against it. Modding the research system seems to be highly problematic for mod conflicts and even being broken by game updates/DLCs in future.

If I am wrong and there is a way to do this robustly please let me know.
